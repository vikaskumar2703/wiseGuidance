# Committing Changes

After making changes to the code, you should commit them to the repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

This command stages all modified and new files for the next commit.

2. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

Replace "Brief description of changes" with a concise summary of the changes you've made.

3. Push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This command pushes your committed changes to the remote repository, assuming the remote is named "origin" and you're working on the "main" branch. Adjust the branch name if you're working on a different branch.
